## Relational database

A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into tables (relations) with rows and columns. Each table represents an entity (like customers or products), and relationships between tables are managed through keys.

Key Concepts:
* Tables: Store data about entities with rows (records) and columns (attributes).
* Primary Key: A unique identifier for each record in a table.
* Foreign Key: Links records between tables, creating relationships.
* Relationships: One-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many connections between tables.
* Normalization: Organizing tables to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
* SQL (Structured Query Language): The language used to query, insert, update, and manage data.
